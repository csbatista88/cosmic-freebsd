The session manager for the COSMIC desktop environment (DE).

cosmic-session is the core component responsible for initializing the
Wayland compositor (cosmic-comp) and launching all necessary components
of the COSMIC shell, such as panels, background services, and input
configuration.

This package provides the necessary binary and desktop file to start a
full COSMIC session from a display manager like SDDM or GDM.
